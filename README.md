# Intervals

This marks the beginning of my dev/devOps path... down the rabbit hole, I go.

As a music teacher, I've long wanted an online business to call my own.   Not a YouTube channel... not a FB group... my own thing...

Where I call ALL the shots.

Well, after years of F**king around I finally realized that I need to sac up and get to work learning how to build my quaint little empire from scratch.  I've looked at a few different languages, scanned through some courses, and figured, 'What the hell, let's do this...'

<h2>The Guitarists' Guide to Intervals</h2>

The Guitarists' Guide to Intervals has been a book idea of mine for quite some time now.  So why not turn it into an interactive app experience..?

I'm still barely learning to crawl with html, css and javascript... but I've stuck with it (among other projects) and I like doing it.  They say the best way to learn is through failure...

Bring it on.

I now have a project that means something to me... 

And that alone is worth a million failures.
